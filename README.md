This repository contains Turbo integrator process. These processes aim to make building models easier and faster than before.
They are inspired by Bedrock library. The processes are : 
- z_Dim.Sub.Create.ByElement.pro : This process creates a subset based on a list of supplied elements.
- z_Cube.Data.ZeroOut.pro : This process automatically creates a view, zeros it out and deletes it.
- z_Cube.ViewAndSubsets.Create.pro : This process creates a processing view for the cube and for specified dimensions of the cube.
- z_Cube.ViewAndSubsets.Delete.pro : This process deletes a view subsets and the view.
